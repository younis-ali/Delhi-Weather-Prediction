# Delhi-Weather-Prediction
This notebook performs the time series weather prediction of temperature in delhi using Deep learning. The other methods available are Regression Models. The reason to choose the Deep learning are:
1. Deep Learing models are good in feature engineering.
2. Deep learning models show good accuracy than regression models.
3. We have Keras framework available that provide most of the deep learing APIs.
